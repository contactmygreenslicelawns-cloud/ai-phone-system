# AI Phone Integration for Green Slice Lawn Care & Window Washing

This system integrates your existing Abacus.ai ChatLLM receptionist (ID: 3947607fe) with phone capabilities using Twilio, enabling voice calls with speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Voice-to-Text**: Automatically transcribes caller speech using Twilio's speech recognition
- **Text-to-Voice**: Responds using natural-sounding AI voices
- **Smart Call Routing**: Forwards calls to owner when needed based on keywords or caller requests
- **Call Recording**: Optional call recording and transcription
- **Push Notifications**: Get notified of incoming calls and their status
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback to human transfer if AI fails

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Twilio account (free trial available)
- Your existing Visible by Verizon phone number
- A server/hosting platform (Render, Heroku, or VPS)

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the files
cd ai_phone_integration

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Edit `.env` file with your details:

```bash
# Get these from Twilio Console (https://console.twilio.com)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here

# Your business phone number (where calls should be forwarded)
OWNER_PHONE=+15551234567

# Your deployed app URL (see deployment section)
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-app-domain.com

# Business name for greetings
BUSINESS_NAME=Green Slice Lawn Care and Window Washing
```

### 4. Deploy the Application

#### Option A: Deploy to Render (Recommended - Free)

1. Create account at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Create new Web Service
4. Set environment variables in Render dashboard
5. Deploy

#### Option B: Deploy to Heroku

```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
heroku create your-app-name
heroku config:set TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
heroku config:set TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
heroku config:set OWNER_PHONE=+15551234567
heroku config:set WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com
git push heroku main
```

#### Option C: Local Testing with ngrok

```bash
# Install ngrok
pip install pyngrok

# Run the app
python app.py

# In another terminal, expose it
ngrok http 5000

# Use the ngrok URL as your WEBHOOK_BASE_URL
```

### 5. Purchase and Configure Twilio Phone Number

```bash
# After deployment, run the setup script
python deploy.py setup-number
```

This will:
- Purchase a Twilio phone number
- Configure voice webhooks
- Set up call status tracking

### 6. Set Up Call Forwarding from Visible

Forward calls from your existing Visible by Verizon number to your new Twilio number:

#### Method 1: Using Star Codes (Recommended)
```
*72 + [Your Twilio Number]
```
Example: `*72-555-123-4567`

#### Method 2: Conditional Forwarding (Busy/No Answer)
```
*71 + [Your Twilio Number]
```

#### To Disable Forwarding
```
*73
```

### 7. Test the System

1. Call your Twilio number directly to test AI responses
2. Call your original Visible number to test forwarding
3. Try different scenarios:
   - Ask about pricing
   - Request to speak to someone
   - Ask about services
   - Say "emergency" to test immediate forwarding

## ðŸ“ž How It Works

1. **Call Received**: Twilio receives the forwarded call
2. **Greeting**: AI greets caller and asks how it can help
3. **Speech Recognition**: Caller's speech is transcribed
4. **AI Processing**: System generates appropriate response
5. **Text-to-Speech**: Response is spoken back to caller
6. **Smart Routing**: Calls are forwarded to owner when needed

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Call Forwarding Keywords

The system automatically forwards calls when these keywords are detected:
- emergency, urgent, complaint
- manager, owner, supervisor
- cancel, refund, problem, issue
- speak to someone, human, representative
- billing, payment issue

### Voice Settings

Customize the AI voice in `app.py`:
```python
# Change voice (options: Polly.Joanna, Polly.Matthew, woman, man)
voice='Polly.Joanna'

# Change language
language='en-US'
```
