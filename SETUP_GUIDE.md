## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Setup

### Phase 1: Get Your Twilio Account Ready (15 minutes)

1. **Create Twilio Account**
   - Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
   - Sign up for a free account ($15 credit included)
   - Verify your phone number

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to https://console.twilio.com
   - Copy your Account SID and Auth Token
   - Keep these safe - you'll need them soon

### Phase 2: Deploy Your AI System (20 minutes)

**Option A: Deploy to Render (Recommended - Free)**

1. Create account at https://render.com
2. Fork this code to your GitHub account
3. Connect GitHub to Render
4. Create new "Web Service"
5. Set these environment variables in Render:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_actual_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_actual_auth_token
   OWNER_PHONE=+1234567890  (your cell number)
   WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.onrender.com
   BUSINESS_NAME=Green Slice Lawn Care and Window Washing
   CHATBOT_ID=3947607fe
   ```
6. Deploy the service

**Option B: Deploy to Heroku**

```bash
# Install Heroku CLI, then:
heroku create your-app-name
heroku config:set TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
heroku config:set TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
heroku config:set OWNER_PHONE=+1234567890
heroku config:set WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com
git push heroku main
```

### Phase 3: Get Your AI Phone Number (10 minutes)

1. **Purchase Twilio Number**
   ```bash
   python deploy.py setup-number
   ```
   This will:
   - Show you available phone numbers
   - Let you choose one
   - Automatically configure it for your AI system
   - Cost: ~$1/month

2. **Test Your AI System**
   - Call your new Twilio number
   - Try saying: "How much does lawn care cost?"
   - Try saying: "I need to speak to the manager" (should forward to you)

### Phase 4: Forward Your Existing Number (5 minutes)

**From your Visible by Verizon phone:**

**For Business Hours (Recommended):**
```
*71 + [Your Twilio Number]
```
Example: `*71-555-123-4567`

This forwards calls only when you're busy or don't answer.

**For After Hours:**
```
*72 + [Your Twilio Number]
```
This forwards ALL calls immediately to AI.

**To Turn Off Forwarding:**
```
*73
```
