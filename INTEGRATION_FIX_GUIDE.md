# üîß AI Receptionist Integration Fix Guide

## üö® **Current Issues Identified**

Your AI receptionist is failing because:
1. **Demo credentials** in environment variables instead of real Twilio credentials
2. **Wrong webhook URL** pointing to localhost instead of Railway deployment
3. **Twilio webhook configuration** not pointing to the correct endpoint

## ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Solution**

### **Phase 1: Get Your Railway URL**

1. **Login to Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Find your AI phone integration project
   - Copy the deployment URL (looks like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`)

2. **Test if Railway App is Running**
   ```bash
   # Replace with your actual Railway URL
   python3 test_deployment.py https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
   ```

### **Phase 2: Update Railway Environment Variables**

In your Railway project dashboard:

1. **Go to Variables tab**
2. **Delete or update these variables:**
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_real_account_sid_from_twilio_console
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_real_auth_token_from_twilio_console
   WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
   OWNER_PHONE=+1234567890  # Your real phone number
   ```

3. **Keep these as they are:**
   ```
   BUSINESS_NAME=Green Slice Lawn Care and Window Washing
   CHATBOT_ID=3947607fe
   ENABLE_CALL_RECORDING=true
   ```

### **Phase 3: Get Real Twilio Credentials**

1. **Login to Twilio Console**
   - Go to [console.twilio.com](https://console.twilio.com)
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Account Info section

2. **Copy Your Credentials:**
   - **Account SID**: Starts with "AC..." (about 34 characters)
   - **Auth Token**: Click "Show" to reveal (about 32 characters)

### **Phase 4: Configure Twilio Webhook**

1. **Go to Phone Numbers**
   - Twilio Console ‚Üí Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active numbers
   - Click on your Twilio phone number

2. **Set Voice Webhook:**
   - **URL**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/voice`
   - **HTTP Method**: POST
   - **Primary Handler Fails**: Leave blank or set fallback URL

3. **Set Status Callback (Optional):**
   - **URL**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/call_status`
   - **HTTP Method**: POST

4. **Save Configuration**

### **Phase 5: Test the Integration**

1. **Test Deployment Health:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Should return JSON with status "healthy"

2. **Test Voice Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/voice \
     -d "From=+15551234567" \
     -d "To=+15559876543" \
     -d "CallSid=test123"
   ```
   Should return TwiML XML

3. **Call Your Twilio Number:**
   - Dial your Twilio phone number
   - Should hear: "Hello! Thank you for calling Green Slice Lawn Care..."

## üîç **Debugging Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: "Webhook Error 11200 or 11205"**
**Cause**: Twilio can't reach your webhook URL
**Solution**:
- Verify Railway app is deployed and running
- Check webhook URL is exactly: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/voice`
- Test URL accessibility from external network

### **Issue 2: "Call Connects but No Voice Response"**
**Cause**: Environment variables not set correctly
**Solution**:
- Check Railway environment variables are saved
- Redeploy after changing variables
- Check Railway logs for errors

### **Issue 3: "App Crashes on Call"**
**Cause**: Missing dependencies or code errors
**Solution**:
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are installed
- Look for Python errors in logs

### **Issue 4: "Immediate Transfer to Owner Phone"**
**Cause**: AI processing failing, triggering fallback
**Solution**:
- Check if OWNER_PHONE is set correctly
- Verify speech processing is working
- Check Railway logs for AI response errors

## üìã **Verification Checklist**

Before testing, ensure:

- [ ] Railway app is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Real Twilio credentials (not demo) are set in Railway
- [ ] WEBHOOK_BASE_URL points to Railway URL (not localhost)
- [ ] Twilio phone number webhook points to Railway `/voice` endpoint
- [ ] OWNER_PHONE is set to your real phone number
- [ ] Railway app health endpoint returns 200 OK

## üß™ **Testing Commands**

Use these commands to test each component:

```bash
# 1. Test Railway deployment
python3 test_deployment.py https://your-app-name.up.railway.app

# 2. Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health

# 3. Test TTS endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/test_tts

# 4. Test voice webhook
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/voice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "From=+15551234567&To=+15559876543&CallSid=test123"
```

## üÜò **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check Twilio Debugger:**
   - Go to Twilio Console ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Debugger
   - Look for recent errors with your phone number
   - Copy error details

2. **Check Railway Logs:**
   - Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments
   - Click on latest deployment ‚Üí View Logs
   - Look for Python errors or HTTP request logs

3. **Test with ngrok (Local Development):**
   ```bash
   # In one terminal
   cd /home/ubuntu/ai_phone_integration
   python3 app.py

   # In another terminal
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
   Use the ngrok URL temporarily in Twilio webhook to test locally

## üìû **Expected Call Flow**

When working correctly:
1. **Call Twilio number** ‚Üí Twilio sends POST to `/voice`
2. **AI greets caller** ‚Üí "Hello! Thank you for calling Green Slice..."
3. **Caller speaks** ‚Üí Twilio transcribes and sends to `/process_speech`
4. **AI responds** ‚Üí Intelligent response based on query
5. **Follow-up or transfer** ‚Üí Continues conversation or transfers to owner

## üéØ **Success Indicators**

‚úÖ Railway health endpoint returns 200  
‚úÖ Voice webhook returns valid TwiML  
‚úÖ Twilio Debugger shows no errors  
‚úÖ Call connects and AI speaks greeting  
‚úÖ Speech recognition and AI responses work  
‚úÖ Transfer to owner phone works when requested
